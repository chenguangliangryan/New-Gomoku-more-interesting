You must have already played the Five in a row  game, then you must know how to play this  chess game.

Game Rule:

The player's goal is to have a majority of their chess pieces showing at the end of the game, turning over as many of their opponent's pieces as possible.

The number of pieces is repeated over and over again, so it is not important to have a number of their own on the front of the board.


Come on, have a try now and you will love this game.
